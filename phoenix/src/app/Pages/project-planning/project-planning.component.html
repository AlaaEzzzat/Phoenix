          Our healthcare planning services focus on providing support in the
          very early phases of planning during which an organization is
          determining the need and feasibility of selected healthcare services.
          PLSI-FZCO's objective in this phase is to assist in meeting the
          community's needs by helping determine a gap analysis, the appropriate
          size & services required.

          PLSI-FZCO has been consulted for many turnkeyhospital development
          projects throughout the project life cycle (Vision - Invest & Funding
          - Design - Build - Equip - Licensing - Recruit & Integrate - Manage &
          Operate). This is further to conducting due diligence for many
          hospitals to improve their profitability, therefore transforming near
          to bankrupt hospitals to highly profitable healthcare operations
          through eliminating unnecessary redundancies then undertaking interim
          management to operate these hospitals during the change management &
          transformation process.
